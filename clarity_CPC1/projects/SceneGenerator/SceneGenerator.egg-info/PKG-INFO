Description: # SceneGenerator
        
        SceneGenerator is used to produce input signals for the hearing aid model (GHA).
        The main function is generate_HA_inputs.py. The generator is driven by json files
        to compile the training and test data from raw inputs. This includes the core
        signal processing steps, including convolution with binaural room impulse responses.
